    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook illustrates text clustering in Python (using mainly sklearn framework). \n",
    "\n",
    "The data consists of ~5k texts (web articles) with tech content, clustered in ~ 480 categories (the data file is attached as \"data.csv\"). The goal is to cluster these articles possibly close to the original labels provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is quite a lot web tutorials on text classification and clustering, this demo shows also presents some less common tricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main finding is that the bag-of-words model (counting keywords frequencies) works pretty well when couppled with few tricks.\n",
    "Ignoring stopwords and stemming terms helps to choose selective and non-redundant keywords.\n",
    "Dimensionality-reduction techniques are necessary, because of too many keywords (a consequence of many clusters). Also, for better peformance, we combine knowledge extracted from titles and full texts in a non-symmetric way (weighted average of two modeles).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, more advanced text-processing techniques (ngrams, lemmatization) and information-theoretic methods of selecting keywords (chi2 or entropy) don't seem to help. This is probably due to the specific content of articles - being related to modern technologies, they are likely to be classified better with single keywords than with phrases and other grammatical variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presented solution achieves accuracy ~ 75.5% (as measured by ARI), when compared with the original labelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Achieving much better results may be more complicated because of highly inbalanced data - many clusters have just few members and are hard to learn.\n"
